Nova Backlog Specifications
===========================

If you have a problem that needs solving, but you are not currently planning
on implementing it, this is the place we can store your ideas.

These specifications have the problem description completed, but all other
sections are optional.

If you are looking for a blueprint to work on, here is a list of specifications
that are looking for owners. If you would like to implement one of these
specifications, fill out the missing sections and follow the standard process
of submitting it to a release (See :doc:`../../readme`).

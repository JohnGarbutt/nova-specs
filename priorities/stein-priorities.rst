Stein Project Priorities
========================

Last cycle, we used only `review runways`_ to capture priorities at any given
time throughout the cycle. We discussed it at the Project Team Gathering (PTG)
during the `Rocky retrospective`_ and determined that while runways were
overall a good process for focusing our review efforts, they were not
sufficient in conveying any overall priorities or themes we were trying to
accomplish over the cycle as a team.

So, this cycle, we came up with a set of `user-facing themes`_ at the PTG, for
ourselves to refer to throughout the cycle and help us to organize our work and
review outside of runways. Themes are not meant to preempt anything in review
runways.

The user-facing themes for this cycle are:

* Compute nodes capable to upgrade and exist with nested resource
  providers for multiple GPU types

* Multi-cell operational enhancements: resilience to "down" or
  poor-performing cells and cross-cell instance resize

* Volume-backed user experience and API hardening: ability to specify
  volume type during boot-from-volume, detach/attach of root volume, and
  volume-backed rebuild

These are the user-visible features and functionality we aim to deliver
and we will keep tabs on these efforts throughout the cycle to keep them
making progress.

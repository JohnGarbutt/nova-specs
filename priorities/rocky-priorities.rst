Rocky Project Priorities
========================

Historically, we have used this document to outline the priority efforts for
reviews during the cycle, as discussed at the Project Team Gathering.

However, for the Rocky cycle, we are trying out a new, approved blueprint
review process called `runways`_ where we have authors add their approved,
ready-for-review blueprints to a queue where it will wait for a runway. Each
runway is a two week long time-box where a blueprint implementation gets
dedicated review priority from the nova-core team. All approved work for the
cycle is subject to the runways process and thus the review priorities for the
cycle are represented by which blueprints are currently occupying runways at
any given time.

Because of this, we are not documenting any particular subset of approved work
as priorities for review during the cycle. Reviewers should consult the runways
etherpad to prioritize their review efforts throughout the cycle.

======================================
Split network plane for live migration
======================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/split-network-plane-for-live-migration

This spec is proposed to split the network plane of live migration from
management network, in order to avoid the network performance impact caused by
data transfer generated by live migration.


Problem description
===================

When we do live migration with QEMU/KVM driver, we use hostname of target
compute node as the target of live migration. So the RPC call and live
migration traffic will be in same network plane. Live migration will have
impact on network performance, and this impact is significant when lots of live
migration occurs concurrently, even if CONF.libvirt.live_migration_bandwidth
is set.


Use Cases
---------

The OpenStack deployer plan a specific network plane for live migration, which
is separated from the management network. As the data transfer of live migrate
is flowing in this specific network plane, its impact to network performance
will be limited in this network plane and will have no impact for management
network. The end user will not notice this change.


Proposed change
===============

Add an new option CONF.my_live_migration_ip in configuration file, set None as
default value. When pre_live_migration() execute in destination host, set the
option into pre_migration_data, if it's not None. When driver.live_migration()
execute in source host, if this option is present in pre_migration_data, the ip
address is used instead of CONF.libvirt.live_migration_uri as the uri for live
migration, if it's None, then the mechanism remains as it is now.

This spec focuses on the QEMU/KVM driver, the implementations for other drivers
should be completed in separate blueprint.


Alternatives
------------

Config live migration uri, like this::

    live_migration_uri = "qemu+tcp://%s.INTERNAL/system"

Then modify the DNS configuration in the OpenStack deployment::

    target_hostname 192.168.1.5

    target_hostname.INTERNAL 172.150.1.5

But requiring such DNS changes in order to deploy and use OpenStack may not be
practical due to organizational procedure limitations at many organizations.

Data model impact
-----------------

None


REST API impact
---------------

None

Security impact
---------------

This feature has no negative impact for security. Split data transfer and
management will improve security somewhat by reducing the chance of a
management plane denial of service.


Notifications impact
--------------------

None

Other end user impact
---------------------

No impact on end user.


Performance Impact
------------------

Using specifically planed network plane, when live migration, the impact of
data transfer on network performance will no longer exist. The impact of live
migration on network performance will be limited to its own network plane.


Other deployer impact
---------------------

The added configuration option CONF.my_live_migration_ip will be available for
all drivers, the default value is None. Thus, when OpenStack upgrades, the
existing live migration mechanism remains, if the option of
CONF.my_live_migration_ip has been set, this option will be used for live
migration's target uri. If the deployers want to use this function, a separated
network plane will have to be planned in advance.


Developer impact
----------------

All drivers can implement this function using the same mechanism.

Work Items
----------

* Add new configuration option CONF.my_live_migration_ip into [DEFAULT] group.

* Modify the existing implementation of live migration, when
  pre_live_migration() execute in destination host, set the option into
  pre_migration_data, if it's not None.
* In QEMU/KVM driver when driver.live_migration() execute in source host, if
  this option is present in pre_migration_data, the ip address is used instead
  of CONF.libvirt.live_migration_uri as the uri for live migration, if it's
  None, then the mechanism remains as it is now.


Dependencies
============

None


Testing
=======

Changes will be made for live migration, thus related unit tests will be added.

Documentation Impact
====================

The instruction for a new configuration option CONF.my_live_migration_ip will
be added to the OpenStack Configuration Reference manual.

The operators can plan a specify network plane for live migration,
like: 172.168.*.*, split it from management network (192.168.*.*), then add the
option into nova.conf on every nova-compute host according to the planed IP
addresses, like this: CONF.my_live_migration_ip=172.168.1.15.

The default value of new option is None, so the live-migration workflow is as
same as the original by default.
